# WHACK!
## A simple game made using Rust.

Whack as many moles as possible before the timer runs out, but be careful, misses will force more moles out of the ground.

## Overview

I have a few aims for the project:

1. Learn the fundamentals of Rust.
1. Get a better understanding of graphics programming.
1. Document as much as possible, including doc tests where appropriate.
1. Write robust tests for the code base.

## To Do

1. Implement miss penalty.
    * Either more moles emerge when an empty tile is hit or a missed hit causes the hit button to lock out for a set amount of time.
1. Add text display for score and instructions.
1. Add graphics for the moles (`tiles`) and the hammer (`cursor`).
1. Add simple animations.
1. Add sound effects.
1. Add difficult modes.
